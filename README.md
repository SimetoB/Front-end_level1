# Front-end_level1
The solution for my Front-end level 1 final

Basic site. Has some links with hover effect, a few images, a form. The bottom 2 images have absolute and relative positions. The form has checkboxes, which are sent to the server in an array.

There's a button, which can add new checkboxes to the form. On clicking send appears a confirmation window, which asks the user if he'd entered the information correctly. If you confirm, the form is sent and a response message appears on the place where the form was. With a button you can return to the form. If you decline the confirmation window, appears an alert, which says you've canceled the sending and nothing happens.
